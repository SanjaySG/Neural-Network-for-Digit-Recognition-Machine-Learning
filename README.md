# Neural-Network-for-Digit-Recognition-Machine-Learning
A 2 layer Neural Network implemented in Python for recognizing digits from 0-9. Training dataset of 60,000 images had been used to train the neural network. After training, the neural network showed accuracies of above 90% on the test dataset.
